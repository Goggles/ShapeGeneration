Shape Generation
================

A collection of scripts written in Python, using the Python Imaging Library, that generate various shapes.

Will be moving through the basic shapes (square, triangle, circle, etc) into more complicated things, like fractals.

Implemented so far:

* Square
* Circle
* Triangle
* Pentagon
* Pentagram
* Triforce
